Music Note : the music learning tool

Hello,
I made this tool to learn how to read music notes.
![](https://github.com/Awot83/MusicNote/blob/master/MUSIC1.gif?raw=true)
Functions:
- 4 notes on a musical stave with their names, (left/right and up/down to modify)
- Press A to switch Treble Key (clef de SOL) and Bass key (clef de FA)
- Press B to hide/unhide the notes names
- Press A+B to randomize the musical notes
- Hold LEFT 2 sec to switch US/FR musical notes (eg. C = DO, D= RE, E=MI...)
